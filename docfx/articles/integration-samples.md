# Integration Samples

The sample gallery includes end-to-end scenarios that show how ProDataGrid can emulate or integrate with other control patterns.

## Mimic Scenarios

- ListBox mimic (with drag and drop, search, filter, and sort model variants).
- TreeView mimic (including hierarchical drag and drop and model-based search/filter/sort).
- PropertyGrid mimic for key/value layouts.
- Mailbox and chat layouts for dense, message-like UIs.
- Flyout-hosted hierarchical picker using `SelectionModel` in a `DropDownButton`.
