The sample app (`src/DataGridSample`) is the fastest way to explore ProDataGrid features and real-world configurations.

Highlights include:

- Column types, editing, and validation.
- Bindable columns, auto-generation, and `DataTable.DefaultView` binding.
- Sorting/filtering/search models, grouping, and paging.
- Selection stability, selection origin logging, and current cell tracking.
- Selection units and highlighting (row vs cell visuals).
- Clipboard export formats and export customization.
- Range interaction model samples (drag thresholds, selection anchors, fill handle ranges).
- Clipboard import model samples (custom paste parsing and transforms).
- Editing interaction model samples (custom edit triggers and input handling).
- Fill handle auto-fill, including custom fill models.
- Conditional formatting model samples (cell and row themes, Power Fx and Excel-like scenarios).
- Hierarchical data, hierarchical drag/drop, and tree-like mimics.
- Virtualization and scrolling diagnostics (large datasets, row height estimators, recycling).
- Styling showcases and column theme usage.

Run it locally:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/DataGridSample/DataGridSample.csproj
```
