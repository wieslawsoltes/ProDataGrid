# Sample Gallery

- The sample app (`src/DataGridSample`) includes pages for column types and validation, bindable columns, pixel-perfect and frozen columns, large datasets, row details, search models, summaries, state persistence, clipboard export, and routed events (`Pages/*Page.axaml`).
- Run it locally with `dotnet run --project src/DataGridSample/DataGridSample.csproj` to see templates, estimators, `SelectedItems` binding, and the `DataTable.DefaultView` page that demonstrates the TypeDescriptor-based column binding.
